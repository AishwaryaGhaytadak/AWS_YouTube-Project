This project aims at analyzing the Twitter data about the most sensitive topic the world is hoping not to escalate further, i.e., Ukraine-Russia War. Here, in this project, we have followed the Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis approach and predicted the sentiment polarity of the Tweets in the below mentioned Categories â€“
1. Highly Positive
2. Positive
3. Neutral
4. Negative
5. Highly Negative

We have implemented 3 models such as Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier and performed hyperparameter tuning to improve the accuracy with best parameters.
Logistic Regression Classifier is the best model with 72% and accuracy of Grid Search CV model with 77%
